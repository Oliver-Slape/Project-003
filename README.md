# Project-003
## Anagram Solver

### Task: Design a system that will allow the player to enter up to 3 random letters. The system will return the best, largest, valid English word that can be made up of the 3 letters (Blanks/spaces are not allowed). For example: TCA should return CAT/ACT, OZR should return OR, ZZA should return A. Extension is adding more letters.

    <h3> As a user I want to be able to input 3 letters. <h3>
    <h3> As a user I want to be able to recieve feedback for incorecct entries. <h3>
    <h3> As a user I want to be able to view my letters at input. <h3>
    <h3> As a user I want the highest value word possible from my entry. <h3>
    <h3> As a user I want feedback to display my  highest value word. <h3>

    <h3> High Level Function Requirements <h3>
        <h4> User can input 3 letters (no spaces/blanks) <h4>
        <h4> System can read and access dictionary or word file <h4>
        <h4> System has algorithm to make highest value word from user input <h4> 
        <h4> Return feedback to user for inputs and Highest value word <h4>
    <h3> High Level Non-Function Requirements <h3>
        <h4> Current development is pure console code based so no design is required <h4>

  <h2> IDE Used and Features <h2>
    <h3> The IDE used was an online service called repl.it It is a colour coordinated IDE with Code hints And a complier with a console debug and input. Additionally, it allows for the upload of files into a project enabling a dictionary or wordlist to be added for this program. <h3>
  <h2> Debugging process <h2>
    <h3> The IDE used as stated above includes a debugging service. This made the Debugging a lot simpler as it pointed to where and why there were errors in the code. After it was jsut a matter of fixing this. This was done by commenting lines of code until the error removes and then editing that section of code line by line till it works. <h3>
  <h2> Coding Standards <h2>
    <h3> With the use of an IDE that colour coordinates the text and code and numbers it makes the layout easier to see and allows for a uniform coding standard. Additionally there is an improved and detailed level of commenting in the project.  <h3>
  <h2> Evaluation <h2>
    <h3> The use of a more intuitive IDE made the process of debugging and having a coding standard as well as it made typing the code faster with hints and auto finish. The extension needs to be completed and there is a minor error where the returned word does'nt use all 3 letters. For example: ZZA returns ZAP rather than A. <h3>
